# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with School Finder TUI in 5 minutes!

## Step 1: Build the Application

```bash
cd /home/zac/projects/sketchpad/tmpdata/schools
go build -o schoolfinder
```

## Step 2: Run It!

```bash
./schoolfinder
```

**First Time Setup:** If you don't have the data files yet, the application will automatically prompt you to download them:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Missing required data files:
   - ccd_sch_029_2324_w_1a_073124.csv
   - ccd_sch_059_2324_l_1a_073124.csv
   - ccd_sch_052_2324_l_1a_073124.csv

Would you like to download them now? (y/N): y
```

The application will download and extract the files automatically (several hundred MB, may take a few minutes).

That's it! You can now search schools.

## Step 3: Try a Search

1. Type a school name, city, or state: `lincoln high`
2. Press `Enter` to search
3. Use arrow keys to browse results
4. Press `Enter` again to view details

## Step 4: Enable AI Features (Optional)

```bash
# Get API key from https://console.anthropic.com
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='sk-ant-your-key-here'

# Run again
./schoolfinder
```

Now when viewing a school, press `Ctrl+A` to extract website data!

## Basic Controls

- `Ctrl+S` to cycle state filters

**Viewing:**
- `Enter` to view school details
- `Ctrl+A` to scrape website (if API key set)

4. **Cached data**: AI extractions are cached for 30 days

## Troubleshooting

**Missing data files?**
- The app will automatically prompt you to download them on first run
- If you declined, run the app again and choose 'y' when prompted
- Files are downloaded from NCES (National Center for Education Statistics)
- Total size: ~several hundred MB

**"No schools found"**
- Try a broader search term
- Check spelling
- Try searching by city or state instead

**"No website available"**
- School doesn't have website in database
- AI scraper won't be available

**AI not working?**
- Did you set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`?
- Check: `echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Get key: https://console.anthropic.com
